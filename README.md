# T-Mobile Boot Sound Remover

This module simply removes the carrier boot sound from startup.
It works by replacing `/system/media/audio/ui/PowerOn.ogg` with another sound file filled with silence.

#Compatibility
This *should* work for most T-Mobile devices. I tested it on an LG V20 (H918) myself, but I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work with any other device.
